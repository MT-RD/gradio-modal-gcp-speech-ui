## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Backend Implementation
**Current Commit**: Phase 2 Frontend - COMPLETED ✅
**Next Commit**: Commit 5 - Google Cloud STT Integration

## Current Working Application

The application is currently running with:
- **Interface**: Fully functional Gradio UI at http://127.0.0.1:7864
- **Features**: File validation, audio preview, enhanced UX
- **Status**: Ready for GCP Speech-to-Text integration

## Quick Start (Current State)

```bash
# 1. Run setup script
./setup.sh

# 2. Edit .env file with your configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file

# 3. Install dependencies
make install

# 4. Check environment
make check-env

# 5. Run the application
make run
# OR for development mode
make dev

# 6. Access the interface
# Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

## Testing Current Features

### 1. Basic File Upload and Validation
1. Run the application: `make run` or `make dev`
2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:7860
3. Test valid audio files (.wav, .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .flac, .aac, .wma under 100MB)
4. Test invalid files (wrong format, too large) to see error handling

### 2. File Information Display
- Upload any valid audio file
- Observe detailed file information (name, size, format, upload time)
- Check the professional error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### 3. Audio Preview
- Upload an audio file
- Use the built-in Gradio audio player to preview the uploaded file
- Verify the interface provides clear instructions and feedback

### 4. Mock Transcription Response
- After uploading a valid file, see the mock transcription response
- Verify the processing status indicators work correctly
- Check that all file validation and information display functions work

All current features are fully functional and ready for the next phase (GCP integration).
